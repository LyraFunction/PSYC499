	abstract = {Gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy, “top” (e.g., chest reconstruction surgery) and “bottom” (e.g., vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, etc.) surgeries, and puberty blockers, is an efficacious treatment of gender dysphoria for transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals. However, many TGNC people encounter significant barriers in accessing gender-affirming care, which we detail via results from on online study. Participants included 256 TGNC individuals (78.9\% White, ages 16–73,
M
age
 = 28.4). Among participants, 61.3\% were receiving hormone therapy, 22.7\% had undergone top surgery, and 5.5\% had undergone bottom surgery. Open-ended responses (
n
 = 201) were thematically analyzed and common barriers included finances and insurance issues, a lack of service availability, and fears or worries. Participants reported various systemic issues and incidents of bias within medical and mental health fields, as well as a lack of medical provider awareness and education. Other themes were interpersonal barriers (e.g., fears of rejection); age and need of parental consent for minors; other medical issues; and a lack of information about how to acquire care. These findings can be utilized to educate professionals in medical and mental health fields about barriers their TGNC patients may encounter in receiving affirming care and suggest a number of ways to improve access to these services.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Gender-related medical misattribution and invasive questioning (GRMMIQ), colloquially known as "trans broken arm syndrome," is a form of medical discrimination faced by transgender and gender diverse (TGD) patients wherein a provider incorrectly assumes that a medical condition results from a patient's gender identity or medical transition. This phenomenon may take one of two forms: (1) the incorrect and explicit misattribution of gender identity or medical transition as being the cause of an acute complaint, or (2) invasive and unnecessary questions regarding a patient's gender identity or gender transition status.
OBJECTIVE: Using mixed-methods procedures, this study aims to explore the incidence, some common correlates, and manifestations of GRMMIQ.
METHODS: American TGD participants (N = 147), recruited through an online recruitment platform, completed questions assessing their experiences in the healthcare system including lifetime incidence of GRMMIQ, outness to healthcare providers, and additional experiences of gender-related discrimination in a medical setting. Participants who indicated experiences of GRMMIQ were asked open-ended questions about one such experience.
RESULTS: Nearly one-third of participants reported experiencing GRMMIQ. Experiences were associated with outness to acute care providers and other types of gender-related discrimination in healthcare settings. Analysis of qualitative data revealed four primary themes: (1) assumptions of disordered thinking and being, (2) hyperfocus on aspects of medical transition, (3) cultural ignorance and incompetence, and (4) dismissiveness of the patient.
CONCLUSION: Together, these results enhance the understanding of an underexplored aspect of medical discrimination faced by TGD individuals while highlighting commonalities across different experiences.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the centrality of ‘coming out’ in the gay rights movement, transgender people may be less likely to disclose their transgender status due to the severity of anti-transgender stigma, structural factors and differences in how transgender status and sexual identity are expressed. As a consequence, intergroup contact with transgender people may be less common than gay contact, which may limit its effectiveness. In Study 1 (N = 174), transgender contact was much less frequent than gay contact, and transgender contact frequency was not associated with anti-transgender bias, although more positive transgender contact was associated with lower anti-transgender bias, and gay contact frequency was also independently associated with lower anti-transgender bias. In Study 2 (N = 277), greater transgender ‘media contact’ was associated with increased empathy for transgender people and decreased anti-transgender bias. In addition, several participants left unsolicited anti-transgender comments at the end of the study, and these participants tended to have less transgender contact and were higher in right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. Our results suggest that increasing contact with the LGBT community and increasing media representations of transgender people may decrease anti-transgender bias. Future directions building on these results are discussed.},

Additionally, the study assessed the possible mediating role of intergroup anxiety in the relationship between intergroup contact and anti-transgender prejudice. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the proposed relationships, controlling for gender, religiosity, and political conservatism. Data were collected from an online sample of 354 participants (males: n = 168; females: n = 186). As hypothesized, greater quantity of contact was uniquely related to less implicit anti-transgender prejudice, whereas greater quality of contact was uniquely related to less explicit and implicit anti-transgender prejudice. Intergroup anxiety mediated the relationships between quality of contact and implicit and explicit anti-transgender prejudice but did not mediate the relationship between quantity of contact and implicit anti-transgender prejudice.},

Two treatments were considered: nonbinary "they/them” and binary "he/him” or "she/her” pronouns congruent with implied sex. Hence, discrimination is estimated against nonbinary and presumed cisgender applicants who disclose pronouns. Results show that disclosing "they/them" pronouns reduces positive employer response by 5.4 percentage points. There is also evidence that discrimination is larger (approximately double) in Republican than Democratic geographies. By comparison, results are inconclusive regarding discrimination against presumed cisgender applicants who disclose pronouns; if discrimination does exist, it is of lower magnitude than discrimination against nonbinary applicants who disclose pronouns.},

Thus, secondary transfer effects, wherein the benefits of contact with one group generalizes to other related groups, may be an important means of transgender prejudice reduction. Across two studies (
N
s = 242 and 172), we assessed the extent to which contact with sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) individuals was associated with secondary transfer effects on transgender prejudice. We also examined the extent to which secondary transfer effects varied by relationship type (i.e., friend, family, acquaintance). Participants completed online surveys that assessed prejudice and contact experience with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. Overall, contact with lesbians and gay men was associated with less prejudice toward transgender individuals indirectly through lower prejudice toward each respective group, and friendships were the most consistent relationship type associated with secondary transfer effects. Contact with bisexuals, as well as family members, was inconsistently associated with transgender prejudice. The findings suggest secondary transfer effects as a potential means of transgender prejudice reduction and emphasize the need to assess relationship type and contact group, as patterns of prejudice reduction were not uniform across groups often perceived to be similar.},

Although the U.S. Census gives a vast undercount of the LGBTQ population, it is still the largest source of nationally representative data on same-sex households and is accessible over three time points (2000, 2010, 2020). In this research note, we use 2020 census data to examine the residential patterns of same-sex households down to the neighborhood level. By employing the index of dissimilarity, we present results for the 100 largest U.S. cities and 100 largest metropolitan areas that demonstrate moderate yet persistent segregation. In a continuation of prior trends, male same-sex households remain more segregated from different-sex households than do female same-sex households. We find moderate levels of within-group segregation by gender and marital status—representing new demographic trends. Finally, metropolitan areas have a higher dissimilarity index than cities, revealing greater levels of segregation when factoring in suburban areas. We discuss these trends in light of debates regarding the spatial organization of sexuality in residential contexts and outline future avenues for research utilizing recently released 2020 census data.},

Past research has found that individual difference variables (e.g., gender, political conservatism) predict transgender prejudice. In the current research, we aimed to better understand the association between transgender prejudice and 15 individual difference predictors (i.e., gender, sexual orientation, single-item political orientation, social dominance orientation, right wing authoritarianism, religiosity, religious fundamentalism, gender essentialism, gender role beliefs, sexism, gender self-esteem, aggression, lesbian, gay, bisexual [LGB] attitudes, contact with LGB individuals, and contact with transgender individuals) by conducting a random-effects meta-analysis. After screening, 82 studies with a total of 36,285 participants met the criteria and were included in the analyses. Across all studies, all predictors except for gender self-esteem (r = .09; 95\% CI [-.004, .18]) were significant in predicting transgender prejudice. Overall, there were small to large effect sizes, with LGB attitudes having the largest magnitude (r = .71; 95\% CI [.65, .76]) and aggression having the smallest magnitude (r = .15; 95\% CI [.08, .23]). These results provide further evidence that attitudes toward transgender people are significantly related to individual differences, gender beliefs, sexual orientation attitudes, and social ideologies.},

	abstract = {Background The difficulties in defining hate crime, hate incidents and hate speech, and in finding a common conceptual basis constitute a key barrier toward operationalisation in research, policy and programming. Definitions disagree about issues such as the identities that should be protected, the types of behaviours that should be referred to as hateful, and how the ‘hate element’ should be assessed. The lack of solid conceptual foundations is reflected in the absence of sound data. These issues have been raised since the early 1990s (Berk, 1990; Byers \& Venturelli, 1994) but they proved to be an intractable problem that continues to affect this research and policy domain. Objectives Our systematic review has two objectives that are fundamentally connected: mapping (1) original definitions and (2) original measurement tools of hate crime, hate speech, hate incidents and surrogate terms, that is, alternative terms used for these concepts (e.g., prejudice-motivated crime, bias crime, among many others). Search Methods We systematically searched over 19 databases to retrieve academic and grey literature, as well as legislation. In addition, we contacted 26 country experts and searched 211 websites, as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature, and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature. Inclusion Criteria This review included documents published after 1990 found in academic literature, grey literature and legislation. We included academic empirical articles with any study design, as well as theoretical articles that focused specifically on defining hate crime, hate speech, hate incidents or surrogate terms. We also reviewed current criminal or civil legislation that is intended to regulate forms of hate speech, hate incidents and hate crimes. Eligible countries included Canada, USA, UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. For documents to be included in relation to research objective (1), they had to contain at least one original definition of hate speech, hate incidents or hate crimes, or any surrogate term. For documents to be included in relation to research objective (2), they had to contain at least one original measurement tool of hate speech, hate incidents or hate crimes, or any surrogate term. Documents could be included in relation to both research objectives. Data Collection and Analysis The systematic search covered 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2021, with searches of academic databases conducted between 8th March and 12th April 2022 yielding 35,191 references. We carried out country-specific searches for grey literature published in the same time period between 27th August and 2nd December 2021. These searches yielded a total of 2748 results. We coded characteristics of the definitions and measurement tools, including the protected characteristics, the approaches to categorise the ‘hate element’ and other variables. We used univariate and bivariate statistical methods for data analysis. We also carried out a social network analysis. Main Results We provide as annex complete lists of the original definitions and measurement tools that met our inclusion criteria, for the use of researchers and policy makers worldwide. We included 423 definitions and 168 measurement tools in academic and grey literature, and 83 definitions found in legislation. To support future research and policy work in this area, we included a synthetic assessment of the (1) the operationalisability of each definition and (2) the theoretical robustness and transparency of each measurement tool. Our mapping of the definitions and measurement tools revealed numerous significant trends, clusters and differences between and within definitions and measurement tools focusing on hate crime, hate speech and hate incidents. For example, definitions and measurement tools tend to focus more on ethnic and religious identities (e.g., racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia) compared to sexual, gender and disability-related identities. This gap is greater in the definitions and measurement tools of hate speech than hate crime. Our analysis showed geographical patterns: hate crime definitions and measurement tools are more likely to originate from Anglophonic countries, especially the USA, but hate speech definitions and measurement tools are more likely to originate from continental Europe. In terms of disciplinary fragmentation, our social network analysis revealed that the collaboration and exchange of conceptual frameworks and methodological tools between social sciences and computer science is limited, with most definitions and measurement tools clustering along disciplinary lines. More detailed findings are presented in the results section of the report. Authors' Conclusions There is an urgent need to close the research and policy gap between the protections of ‘ethnic and religious identities’ and other (less) protected characteristics such as gender and sexual identities, age and disability. There is also an urgent need to improve the quality of methodological and reporting standards in research examining hate behaviours, including transparency in methodology and data reporting, and discussion of limitations (e.g., bias in data). Many of the measurement tools found in the academic literature were excluded because they did not report transparently how they collected and analysed the data. Further, 41\% of documents presenting research on hate behaviours did not provide a definition of what they were looking at. Given the importance of this policy domain, it is vital to raise the quality and trustworthiness of research in this area. This review found that researchers in different disciplinary areas (e.g., social sciences and computer science) rarely collaborate. Future research should attempt to build on existing definitions and measurement tools (instead of duplicating efforts), and engage in more interdisciplinary collaborations. It is our hope that that this review can provide a solid foundation for researchers, government, and other bodies to build cumulative knowledge and collaboration in this important field.},

A systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted by including studies that examined the efficacy of weight bias reduction interventions for healthcare students. Of the 3463 journal articles and dissertations screened, 67 studies (within 64 records) met inclusion criteria, with 35 studies included in the meta-analyses (explicit = 35, implicit [and explicit] = 10) and 32 studies included in the narrative synthesis (explicit = 34, implicit [and explicit] = 3). Weight bias interventions had a small but positive impact, g = −0.31 (95\% CI = −0.43 to −0.19, p {\textless} 0.001), in reducing students' explicit weight bias but there was no intervention effect on implicit weight bias, g = −0.12 (95\% CI = −0.26 to 0.02, p = 0.105). There was considerable heterogeneity in the pooled effect for explicit bias (I2 = 74.28, Q = 132.21, df = 34, p {\textless} 0.001). All subgroup comparisons were not significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) and were unable to explain the observed heterogeneity. Narrative synthesis supported meta-analytic findings. The small but significant reduction of explicit weight bias encourages the continued testing of interventions, irrespective of variation in individual intervention components. Contrarily, reductions in implicit weight bias may only be possible from a large societal shift in negative beliefs and attitudes held towards people living in larger bodies.},

	abstract = {The present article presents a meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. With 713 independent samples from 515 studies, the meta-analysis finds that intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice. Multiple tests indicate that this finding appears not to result from either participant selection or publication biases, and the more rigorous studies yield larger mean effects. These contact effects typically generalize to the entire outgroup, and they emerge across a broad range of outgroup targets and contact settings. Similar patterns also emerge for samples with racial or ethnic targets and samples with other targets. This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport's optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice. Closer examination demonstrates that these conditions are best conceptualized as an interrelated bundle rather than as independent factors. Further, the meta-analytic findings indicate that these conditions are not essential for prejudice reduction. Hence, future work should focus on negative factors that prevent intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice as well as the development of a more comprehensive theory of intergroup contact.

Promoting intergroup harmony requires knowledge about what works to reduce prejudice in community settings. This meta‐analysis of field experiments reveals the most effective intervention types and conditions for reducing negative attitudes towards minority groups in real‐world settings. Across 69 intervention arms and 24,378 participants, results reveal that prejudice reduction interventions are effective at improving attitudes towards minority groups in real‐world settings (d = 0.51, 95\% CI [0.33; 0.68]). The prediction interval was −0.90 to 1.92. In this case, the prediction interval was particularly wide because of the high degree of heterogeneity detected in effect size. Subgroup analyses indicate that less commonly explored approaches, such as perceived variability, may have larger effect sizes than contact‐based interventions. Still, more research is needed to confirm the effects of these less‐researched approaches. Additionally, results show that interventions are more effective for school and college cohorts than for adults, and that the effects of prejudice reduction interventions endure over time.},

Jackson synthesizes new research from various areas of psychology to analyze contemporary examples of prejudice, including anti-immigrant policies, police violence against minorities, anti-woman and LGBTQ backlash, and ageist cultural biases. She also explores frequently overlooked issues related to prejudice, such as environmental inequality and speciesism. Drawing from literature in evolutionary, developmental, social, and personality psychology, Jackson explores the biological and environmental roots of prejudice, including how people develop essentialist views in childhood and learn to favor ingroup members and dehumanize outgroup members. She draws connections between these beliefs and other social justice issues showing how they give rise to greater social problems like inequality and political polarization. She also offers readers a blueprint for overcoming these deeply embedded biases by improving intergroup attitudes and building communities to create progressive social change"--},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

In a controlled experimental setting, we found that a favorable ruling, when presented as likely, shifted perceived norms and personal attitudes toward increased support for gay marriage and gay people. Next, a five-wave longitudinal time-series study using a sample of 1,063 people found an increase in perceived social norms supporting gay marriage after the ruling but no change in personal attitudes. This pattern was replicated in a separate between-subjects data set. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that an institutional decision can change perceptions of social norms, which have been shown to guide behavior, even when individual opinions are unchanged.},

Trump’s comments constituted a departure from the egalitarian norms that had long characterized American political discourse. Here, we examine the potential effects of Trump’s rhetoric on Americans’ attitudes, predicting that these high-profile norm violations may have reshaped the personal prejudices of the American people. In 13 studies including over 10,000 participants, we tested how Americans’ prejudice changed following the political ascension of Donald Trump. We found that explicit racial and religious prejudice significantly increased amongst Trump’s supporters, whereas individuals opposed to Trump exhibited decreases in prejudice. Further, changing social norms appear to explain these changes in prejudice. These results suggest that Trump’s presidency coincided with a substantial change in the topography of prejudice in the United States.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, researchers have demonstrated that general Christian religiosity is associated with prejudice against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer+ (LGBTQ+) people. However, we know of no research that has examined whether this association differs between Christians who perceived their church as openly affirming (“OAC attendees”) and those who did not (“non-OAC attendees”). In two studies, we examined the relationship between general Christian religiosity and evaluations of LGBTQ+ target groups among cisgender heterosexual “OAC attendees” and “non-OAC attendees.” Overall, we found that, although Christian religiosity was generally associated with negative evaluations of LGBTQ+ targets, these associations were stronger among “non-OAC attendees” compared to “OAC attendees.” These results suggest that OACs may mitigate prejudice against LGBTQ+ people among cisgender heterosexual Christians, selectively attract highly religious Christians who are already low in prejudice, and/or attract Christians with a general positive disposition (e.g., positivity bias). Regardless, our findings add nuance to the well-known association between Christian religiosity and prejudice against LGBTQ+ people. We discuss implications and directions for future research.

G*Power 3 is a major extension of, and improvement over, the previous versions. It runs on widely used computer platforms (i.e., Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Mac OS X 10.4) and covers many different statistical tests of the t, F, and chi2 test families. In addition, it includes power analyses for z tests and some exact tests. G*Power 3 provides improved effect size calculators and graphic options, supports both distribution-based and design-based input modes, and offers all types of power analyses in which users might be interested. Like its predecessors, G*Power 3 is free.},

Several patterns of group differences in linear growth trajectories were considered. SEM growth modeling consistently showed higher statistical power for detecting group differences in the linear growth slope than repeated-measures ANOVA. For small group differences in the growth trajectories, large sample size (e.g., N {\textgreater} 500) would be required for adequate statistical power. For medium or large group differences, moderate or small sample size would be sufficient for adequate power. Some future research directions are discussed.},

A number of critics predicted that President Trump’s divisive rhetoric during the presidential campaign and his subsequent election would embolden hate crime perpetrators, thereby contributing to more hate crimes. Media commentators have dubbed this the Trump Effect.We find compelling evidence to support the Trump Effect hypothesis. Using time series analysis, we show that Donald Trump’s election in November of 2016 was associated with a statistically significant surge in reported hate crimes across the United States, even when controlling for alternative explanations. Further, by using panel regression techniques, we show that counties that voted for President Trump by the widest margins in the presidential election also experienced the largest increases in reported hate crimes. Using the data from this study, we offer a novel theory that builds on the existing literature on the causes of hate crimes. We hypothesize that it was not just Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric throughout the political campaign that caused hate crimes to increase. Rather, we argue that it was Trump’s subsequent election as President of the United States that validated this rhetoric in the eyes of perpetrators and fueled the hate crime surge.},

The present study, using a sample of American adults (n=406), investigated whether two ideological beliefs, namely, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) uniquely predicted Trump support and voting intentions for Clinton. Cognitive ability as a predictor of RWA and SDO was also tested. Path analyses, controlling for political party identification, revealed that higher RWA and SDO uniquely predicted more favorable attitudes of Trump, greater intentions to vote for Trump, and lower intentions to vote for Clinton. Lower cognitive ability predicted greater RWA and SDO and indirectly predicted more favorable Trump attitudes, greater intentions to vote for Trump and lower intentions to vote for Clinton.},

Our analysis uses individual‐level data and a range of perceived threat measures to better understand the dynamics of authoritarianism and threat. We also move beyond the hypothesis of a direct relationship between threat and authoritarianism, and hypothesize instead that the relationship involves interaction effects: societal threat activates authoritarian predispositions. As predicted, our analysis finds no evidence of a direct effect of societal threat but significant evidence of an interaction between authoritarian predispositions and perceived threat.

Using data from the largest survey of transgender adults in the United States, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 4,115), we examine the associations among gender nonconformity, transphobic discrimination, and health-harming behaviors (i.e., attempted suicide, drug/alcohol abuse, and smoking). The results suggest that gender nonconforming trans people face more discrimination and, in turn, are more likely to engage in health-harming behaviors than trans people who are gender conforming.

	abstract = {Background and Objectives
Amidst the growing global visibility of older lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and gender and sexually diverse (LGBTQ+) individuals, the predominantly American research has established that they face continued prejudice and discrimination. Yet, few studies outside of the United States have examined their life course experiences, including those related to adverse events. Building on the existing research, the present qualitative study uses a life-course perspective to explore older LGBTQ+ Canadians’ experiences of prejudice and discrimination.

Research Design and Methods
We recruited and conducted multiple, in-depth, semistructured qualitative interviews with 30 LGBTQ+ Canadian individuals, aged 65 to 83, about their life course experiences, including if and how they had been treated differently because of their gender identities, sexual orientations, and ages. Interview transcriptions were coded and analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis.

Results
All 30 participants reported traumatic and adverse experiences in patterned ways across the life course. Whereas they often faced abuse and harassment in childhood and young adulthood, they frequently reported institutionally situated prejudice and discrimination in midlife. Despite changing laws and social norms, in later life participants were subjected to targeted mistreatment and systemic neglect and exclusion as a result of their gender identities, sexual orientations, and ages.

Discussion and Implications
Findings from this study corroborate previous research and shed light on the ways that prejudice and discrimination have often permeated the lives of older LGBTQ+ Canadians. The research also points to the continued and urgent need to fight bigotry through education, policy, and progressive legislation.},

Furthermore, this contact effect extended even, and perhaps especially, to people who otherwise displayed more negative prior attitudes and lower propensities for gay and lesbian acquaintanceship.},

Confirmatory factor analysis supports this two-factor structure. In undergraduate and nationally representative samples, we demonstrate that moral disapproval relates to higher religiosity (Studies 1a-1b), whereas outgroup antipathy relates to generalized and racial prejudice (Study 2). Further, outgroup contact predicts reductions in antipathy throughout college students' first semester, whereas religious sources contribute to moral disapproval across the semester (Study 3). Finally, moral disapproval relates to negativity toward sexually active single targets regardless of sexual orientation, whereas outgroup antipathy relates to negativity toward gay/lesbian targets regardless of sexual behavior (Study 4).

We test meta-analytically the three most studied mediators: contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing empathy and perspective taking. Our tests reveal mediational effects for all three of these mediators. However, the mediational value of increased knowledge appears less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy.

In Study 1, we tested the interaction between contact quantity and valence on prejudice toward Black Australians (n = 1,476), Muslim Australians (n = 173), and asylum seekers (n = 293). In all cases, the association between contact quantity and prejudice was moderated by its valence, with negative contact emerging as a stronger and more consistent predictor than positive contact. In Study 2, White Americans (n = 441) indicated how much positive and negative contact they had with Black Americans on separate measures. Although both quantity of positive and negative contact predicted racism and avoidance, negative contact was the stronger predictor. Furthermore, negative (but not positive) contact independently predicted suspicion about Barack Obama’s birthplace. These results extend the contact hypothesis by issuing an important caveat: Negative contact may be more strongly associated with increased racism and discrimination than positive contact is with its reduction.},

	abstract = {Hate crimes are notoriously underestimated evident by significant differences reported between the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). Between 2004 and 2012, an average of 269,000 victimizations were reported by the NCVS; simultaneously, UCR hate crime statistics reported an average of 8,770 incidents (FBI UCR Hate Crime Statistics, 2004-2012) implicating sizable hate crime underreporting. We present two hypotheses to explain the dark figure of hate crime reporting. First, we hypothesize that bias crime victims, relative to nonbias crime victims, are less likely to report their victimization to police. Second, we hypothesized that misperceptions of police legitimacy by groups with strained relations with police who are also at risk for hate victimization explain declinations to report. Using stepwise logistic regression, controlling in subsequent models with victim, offender, and situational factors previously found to increase nonbias crime victim reporting, we detected an increasingly stronger propensity for bias crime victims to not report their victimization. We also found that victim misperception of police legitimacy evident by the absence of confidence (29.2\%) and victim decisions to report to different official (22.3\%) largely explain underreporting. Implications for victim perceptions of police legitimacy and their ability to discharge procedural justice are discussed. Improved public relations with communities who sustain a strained relationship with police in conjunction with proactive, clear enforcement policies, and practices are suggested.},

The catalyst for change was the tragic murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, when the police and other agencies were found to have failed Stephen’s family. Whilst no one in the UK establishment would claim that the situation is now perfect, the UK does stand out as having one of the most progressive and holistic responses with a robust legal framework, comprehensive data, and transparent policies for professionals. Key to the UK strategy is the involvement of victims, advocates, and academics at all levels of policy development and a programme that brings all stakeholders together to ensure consistent services. This chapter examines the developments since 1993 and identifies those elements that could be of value to other states who are seeking to improve their own responses.},

Bisexuals (n = 132) between the ages of 18 and 49 completed an online survey assessing their experiences as a bisexual person, perceptions of reproducing sexually, and their dating habits. Results suggest pressure to conform to heterosexual social norms and the makeup of the available dating pool play a role in bisexuals’ decisions to date the opposite sex.},

Significantly increased levels of offender substance use, crimes perpetrated by multiple offenders, crimes perpetrated by acquaintances, and crimes taking place in open spaces substantiates the theory that anti-LGBTQ hate is qualitatively unique, typified by different characteristics than other forms of crime. The data in this study also supports that anti-LGBTQ hate is not a homogenous phenomenon. Significant numbers of anti-LGBTQ hate incidents committed by known offenders including friends, family, and intimates, and crimes committed in private locations such as residences suggest that multiple dynamic processes may underlie this type of crime.},

We propose that legal inequalities increase hate crimes because they provide discursive opportunities for bias, discrimination, and violence. Legal equality, however, will reduce violence. Using annual panel data from 2000 to 2012, a period of substantial policy change, we analyze how three state policies affect reported hate crimes: same-sex partnerships, employment non-discrimination, and hate crime laws. Hate crime and employment non-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation reduce hate crime incidence. Partnership recognition increases reported hate crimes, though it may not increase actual crime incidence. Because incidence is spatially correlated, policy changes in one state yield spillover benefits in other states. These results provide some of the first quantitative evidence that public policies affect hate crimes based on sexual orientation. Findings confirm the roles of institutional heterosexism and discursive opportunities in producing hate crimes.},

            As a stigmatized and vulnerable population, sexual minorities are often assumed to also be a hard-to-survey population. Despite this implicit assumption, there is little empirical evidence on the topic. Using a nationally representative survey that included sexual orientation (the Census Barriers, Attitudes, and Motivators Survey), we examine level of effort, the Census Bureau’s Low Response Score (LRS), and stated intent to respond to the 2020 Census as proxy measures to explore this assumption. We found no evidence that sexual minorities required higher levels of effort to secure participation in the survey. Additionally, we found that compared to straight respondents, lesbians, gays, and bisexuals had a higher intent to respond to the 2020 Census. We surmise the current social climate in the United States may be a contributing factor to these findings.},

	abstract = {Conspiracy theories and beliefs against LGBTQ+ people are a recurrent theme in the political agenda, depicting them as evil actors in a larger plot, seeking to undermine societal norms, institutions, and traditional values. Lessening LGBTQ+ conspiracy beliefs is crucial to reaching more social equality, and intergroup contact might represent a useful strategy. Study 1 (N = 253) investigated the associations of the quantity of direct contact with LGBTQ+ people, the quality of such contacts, and their interactive role with LGBTQ+ conspiracy beliefs. Taking a step forward, Studies 2 (N = 512) and 3 (N = 529) investigated, correlationally and experimentally, respectively, the relationship between the quality of contact with LGBTQ+ individuals and LGBTQ+ conspiracy beliefs, exploring the mediating associations of intergroup knowledge, empathy, and anxiety. Results consistently suggested that a higher quantity of direct contacts with LGBTQ+ people is negatively associated with LGBTQ+ conspiracy beliefs. Furthermore, positive contact was associated with lower conspiracy beliefs against LGBTQ+ people, with these associations being either partially (Study 2) or fully (Study 3) mediated by intergroup empathy. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of fostering positive intergroup interactions and enhancing empathy as strategies to combat harmful conspiracy beliefs about marginalized groups.},

	abstract = {We examine the roles of gender, gender attitudes, and interest in sports on public attitudes about transgender people’s participation in athletics. Using a representative survey of 1020 adults in the United States from 2015 and after controlling for a variety of demographic, political, and attitudinal factors, we find that women, consistent with their gender identity, are more supportive than men of transgender athletes participating in sports. In addition, we find that individuals who hold traditional gender role beliefs and those who have greater gender identity conformity with their gender are less likely to support transgender athletes’ participation. The effects of gender identity conformity and beliefs in traditional gender roles are also conditioned by respondents’ gender. Sports fans are more likely to oppose transgender athletes’ participation, and female sports fans have views that resemble those of male sports fans. Finally, respondents who have contact with transgender people and those with stronger egalitarian attitudes are more favorable toward transgender participation whereas those espousing high moral traditionalism are more opposed. Our findings highlight areas of support and resistance to transgender athletes, and our work might be helpful to policymakers, as well as advocates, who promote inclusion.},

The goal of this article is to analyze the relationship between religion, measured in terms of religious affiliation and religiosity, and public opinion about same-sex marriage, civil unions, and a federal constitutional amendment that would prohibit gay marriage. Methods. We use logistic regression with calculated standardized coefficients to analyze data from a nationally representative survey of 1,610 respondents conducted in March–April 2004. Results. Religious variables perform better than demographic measures in models of attitudes about same-sex unions. Non-Protestants are much more likely to support same-sex unions than are Protestants, and individuals with conservative attitudes toward morality and secularism and (to a lesser extent) those who participate actively in religious life are more likely to oppose such unions. On the whole, religious variables play a weaker role in predicting support for a constitutional amendment to prevent gay marriage than they do in predicting attitudes toward same-sex unions. Conclusions. Religious variables play powerful roles in structuring attitudes about same-sex unions. Moreover, homosexuality appears to be a major component of the "moral values" discourse that is currently so popular in American politics.},

It can powerfully shape public attitudes, especially on issues of sexual purity, but that efficacy must come with a strong caveat: our findings show that some members of the public will reject disgust rhetoric as an indignant reaction against the speaker.},

	abstract = {Transgender people face an uncertain legal climate, and efforts to include gender identity in policies have been met with both successes and failures. These policies are often developed in the legislative process, which directly involve public opinion. To date, there is only one study analyzing American public attitudes toward transgender people. This research gap makes it unclear whether people in general understand what transgender means and whether public support for transgender rights depends on understanding and knowing transgender people. Since the population of transgender people is estimated to be smaller than that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, examining whether and how having a friend or family member who is lesbian or gay relates to transgender rights is important to understand political coalitions and attitude change. This study examines public attitudes about transgender rights in the USA. It finds that as respondents report being more informed about transgender people they tend to have more supportive attitudes. Interpersonal contact with someone who is lesbian or gay also leads to a secondary transfer of positive attitudes. About half of the secondary transfer effect operates through a mechanism of attitude generalization: contact positively affects the opinions people have on gay rights that then broaden to affect attitudes on transgender rights. Demographic characteristics also indicate that predictors of transgender attitudes are similar to previous studies regarding attitudes toward lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals. Further survey efforts need to consider inquiring about transgender rights and attitudes, as this remains a research gap in need of scholarly understanding.},

	abstract = {Attitudes toward gay men and lesbians in the United States have liberalized dramatically over time yet vary substantially between states. Trends in college attainment mirror this uneven progress. This study draws on theories of the university as a cultural institution to examine the relationship between college-educated populations and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians over time and across American states. Employing 1984–2016 American National Election Studies data, this study demonstrates that larger shares of college graduates in a state are associated with more favorable attitudes on average toward gay men and lesbians, including among those who do not have a college degree. These results are robust to competing state-level religious, political, and economic explanations. Results also show that individuals in states with more college graduates are more likely to identify as LGB. This increases the likelihood of knowing someone who is LGB, which in turn leads to more accepting views. Cultural values of tolerance and acceptance espoused by university graduates may create social contexts in which sexual minorities feel safe to come out, thus increasing the visibility of sexual minority communities and enhancing favorable attitudes.},

	abstract = {Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in the United States (US) are disproportionately exposed to interpersonal violence, which carries a high conditional risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and which is often motivated by sexual prejudice. We determined PTSD prevalence by violence attribution (motivated by sexual prejudice or not) and measured PTSD–attribution associations. Using a 2020 nationwide cross-sectional survey of 2,886 GBMSM who reported ever experiencing interpersonal violence, we performed multivariable modified Poisson regressions with robust variance estimators to examine differences in prevalence of current PTSD by how participants attributed the violence (occurring due to one’s same-sex practices, not occurring due to one’s same-sex practices, or being unsure if it occurred due to one’s same-sex practices). Model results are reported as adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Median age was 27 years; 78.8\% of participants identified as gay, and 62.2\% were non-Hispanic White. Violence was attributed to same-sex practices by 45.8\% of participants; 46.3\% did not make this attribution, and 7.0\% were unsure (0.9\% preferred not to answer). Overall, 23.0\% screened positive for PTSD, and PTSD prevalence was greater for those who attributed violence to same-sex practices (25.9\% [342/1,321]; aPR = 1.55, 95\% CI [1.34, 1.79]) and those who were unsure (33.5\% [68/203]; aPR = 1.80, 95\% CI [1.44, 2.25]) compared to those who did not make the attribution (18.1\% [242/1,335]). Age modified this association, with participants 15 to 19 years old who made the attribution being significantly more likely to have PTSD relative to 20+ participants who also made the attribution. In addition to violence-prevention and stigma-mitigation efforts, interventions targeting attribution styles may be useful for violence-exposed GBMSM, especially teenagers.},

In order to test this assumption, the current authors examined the questionnaire answers from a total of 452 Chinese undergraduates who participated in this study. The results showed that disgust sensitivity was positively correlated with negative attitudes toward homosexuality, and positively correlated with moral concerns in five domains (care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity). Authority and sanctity were both associated with attitudes toward homosexuality, while only sanctity mediated the relationship between disgust sensitivity and attitudes toward homosexuality. Overall, the results suggest that considering moral foundations (especially sanctity) may lend more insight to the associations between disgust sensitivity and negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian people.},

Adding to this body of literature, we sought to investigate relationships between attitudes toward different sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) minority groups. University student participants (N = 495) were asked to rate 11 targets using a 101-point feeling thermometer scale. The targets included trans, bisexual, asexual, and polyamorous men and women, along with lesbians, gay men, and gender non-conforming persons. Heterosexual men and women targets were included for comparison. Analyses addressed two main question areas: (1) Were the various SOGI minority targets rated similarly/differently? (2) Do ratings of the targets differ as a function of target and participant demographic characteristics? Generally, SOGI ratings were favourable (78–85\%) except for polyamorous targets (66\%). While there were some statistically significant rating differences between some SOGI targets (e.g., lesbians were rated more favourably than asexual women; 85\% versus 83\%, respectively), data reduction analyses (i.e., Principal Components Analysis) with the 11 SOGI target ratings supported the possibility of aggregating attitudes into a single SOGI target group variable. The second research goal involved exploring whether ratings differed as a function of participant characteristics, including sexual orientation, gender, and religiosity. The analysis revealed that attitudes significantly differed based on all three participant factors. In general, those who rated the targets most favourably were those who were queer, women, or not-at-all religious. However, the SOGI target gender did not result in differences in target ratings (e.g., asexual women and asexual men were equal). The findings further the literature on attitudes toward various SOGI minorities, providing support for the theory that there is a latent factor underlying perceiver attitudes toward SOGI minorities and indicating a need to consider demographic characteristics of social perceivers.},

	abstract = {The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) population is at a substantially elevated risk for myriad health complications, due in large part to structural and social inequities. As such, the LGBTQ population is an important demographic to survey regarding their health. As with many populations facing inequality, the LGBTQ population is often hard to sample. In light of this challenge, several approaches may be required in order to effectively surveying this population. Specifically, advances in sampling methodologies, leveraging community partnerships, and culturally aware question design appear to increase the likelihood of a successful LGBTQ-focused health survey. The Southern LGBTQ Health Study is examined as a case study in effectively conducting a large, multi-state LBTQ health survey. They used a simple snowball sampling strategy where their online health survey was distributed through a wide network of community organizations across several states. They also employed members of the LGBTQ community as “Survey Ambassadors” to help recruit their peers to participate in the study. This case study demonstrated several successful methods. Their combined sampling methodology resulted in almost 6000 respondents. Their question for sexual orientation (“Check all that apply”) resulted in rich, easy to interpret data and was well received by the participants. However, this case study also provided valuable learning opportunities. Had they used a more formalized approach to their sampling, they would have had greater generalizability to their target population. Also, the use of an open-ended question regarding gender identity generated data that was not conducive to formal analysis without significant resources dedicated to cleaning the data.},

	abstract = {Using General Social Survey data from 1973 to 1998, changing American attitudes toward homosexuality are examined. Two hypotheses are tested: (1) Can changes in attitudes be accounted for by the changing demographics of the population? (2) Are changing attitudes toward homosexuality embedded within larger cultural ideological shifts? The data indicate that Americans distinguish between the morality of homosexuality and the civil liberties of homosexuals. Americans became increasingly negative regarding the morality of homosexuality through 1990, but since then their attitudes have become increasingly liberal. The same 25–year period witnessed a steady decline in Americans’ willingness to restrict the civil liberties of homosexuals. Changes in American demographics—particularly increasing educational levels—and changing cultural ideological beliefs can account for only about one-half of the change over time in attitudes toward homosexuality. Several theories are put forth to explain these patterns of change and the distinction made between morality and civil liberties.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this article is to examine the trend in attitudes toward gay marriage through the analysis of data from the General Social Survey. Methods: Using linear decomposition techniques, I explain the change in attitudes toward gay marriage from 1988 to 2006. Results: Attitudes significantly liberalized over time; 71 percent opposed gay marriage in 1988, but by 2006, this figure dropped to 52 percent. Approximately two-thirds of this change was due to an intracohort change effect, or individuals’ modifying their views over time, and one-third was due to a cohort succession effect, or later cohorts replacing earlier ones. This pattern was replicated across many subgroups of the U.S. public, including age, sex, residential, educational, and religious groups. Conclusion: The results suggest that the use of the "equality/tolerance" framing of gay marriage by its supporters and other societal events or "moments" may have convinced some people who used to disapprove of gay marriage in 1988 to approve of it by 2006.

At both time points, Democrats and Republicans rated their own party's candidate similarly on the three trait dimensions and overall favorability. They differed, however, in evaluations of the other party's candidate. Republicans viewed Biden more positively both overall and on the trait dimensions than Democrats viewed Trump. Favorability ratings and trait perceptions for one's own party candidate were comparable pre‐ and postelection but were more negative postelection for the opposite party's candidate. RWA predicted favorability toward Trump, above and beyond political affiliation and sociodemographic factors, at both time points in addition to MS preelection and SDO postelection; RWA negatively predicted favorability toward Biden pre‐ but not postelection. Moreover, RWA predicted a vote for Trump versus Biden above and beyond political affiliation, highlighting the importance of considering sociopolitical attitudes in political decision‐making.},

	abstract = {Early legal challenges to the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act were originally excused on the argument that hate crimes “hurt more,” but there remain some empirical gaps on this topic. Although many works have concluded that biased offenders cause greater harms to their victims relative to unbiased perpetrators, this effect tends to be sensitive to individual and situational factors like victim and offender characteristics, bias motivation, weapon use, or crime location. This type of confounding has the potential to introduce selection bias in the estimation of victimization harms among biased criminal incidents. With data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (2010–2020), I use propensity scores and inverse-probability weighting to show that, on average, victims of bias motivated offenses are more likely to report later physical and emotional harms despite not suffering greater initial injury in incidence. Findings also demonstrate that the harm of hate varies across different bias motivations, with such crimes directed toward those on the basis of disability, gender, and sexual orientation causing greater short- and long-term individual trauma and damage.},

Results reveal high wave-to-wave rank-order stability for RWA, SDO, and generalized prejudice. Adjusting for their between-person stability, RWA and SDO predicted within-person increases in generalized prejudice. Results replicated when predicting (a) prejudice toward three specific minority groups (namely, Ma¯ori, Pacific Islanders, and Asians) and (b) anti-minority beliefs. These findings demonstrate that RWA and SDO are highly stable over 10 consecutive years and that they independently precede within-person annual increases in generalized prejudice and anti-minority beliefs.},

	abstract = {Prior research has begun the task of assessing the applicability of group threat theory to explain sexual orientation hate crime. Drawing upon this perspective, researchers have hypothesized that relatively large and growing gay populations might be perceived as a threat to heterosexual norms, leading to sexual orientation hate crimes. Previous work has also identified an additional source of threat that may be particularly salient: threat to traditional marriage. Using data for a sample of metropolitan areas, we assess the impact of a previously unexamined potential source of threat: same-sex marriage. We also compare the relationships between the relative size and growth of the gay population and hate crimes expressed as incidence and victimization rates. The results reveal that the effects of the gay population’s relative size on incidence vs. victimization rates differ in important respects, and that the level of same-sex marriage is positively associated with both hate crime rates.},

This is consistent with the laws increasing tolerance toward and acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, further supported by complementary analysis from Google Trends data. This is also the first study to examine the effects of marriage equality on allegations of employment discrimination due to sexual orientation based on information from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The findings support that marriage equality laws have an additional beneficial effect: the laws not only decrease hate crimes, but they also decrease the incidence of employment discrimination (at worst, the laws do not affect discriminatory practices).},

Participants were 336 self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) community members who elected to participate in research at a community health agency in an urban southwestern United States jurisdiction. Results suggested (a) approximately one third of the sample reported lifetime hate crime victimization, with the most common types characterized by interpersonal, as opposed to property, crimes; (b) approximately half of participants reported their most recent victimization to law enforcement; and (c) internalized SMS stress mediated the relation between hate crime victimization and overall mental health symptoms.

Hate crime data collection was required by the Act to begin in calendar year 1990 and to continue for four successive years. In September 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act amended the Hate Crime Statistics Act to add disabilities, both physical and mental, as factors that could be considered a basis for hate crimes. Although the Act originally mandated data collection for five years, the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 amended the collection duration "for each calendar year," making hate crime statistics a permanent addition to the UCR program. As with the other UCR data, law enforcement agencies contribute reports either directly or through their state reporting programs. Information contained in the data includes number of victims and offenders involved in each hate crime incident, type of victims, bias motivation, offense type, and location type.},

A special case are frequency measurements of behaviors or events, such as doctor visits per month or crimes committed per year. Probability distributions for such outcomes include the Poisson or negative binomial distribution and their zero-inflated extensions to account for excess zero counts. This article demonstrates how to specify, evaluate, and interpret LGMs for count outcomes using the Mplus program in the structural equation modeling framework. The foundations of LGMs for count outcomes are discussed and illustrated using empirical count data on self-reported criminal offenses of adolescents (N = 1,664; age 15–18). Annotated syntax and output are presented for all model variants. A negative binomial LGM is shown to best fit the crime growth process, outperforming Poisson, zero-inflated, and hurdle LGMs.},

This increase in the complexity of our theoretical propositions regarding behavior parallels recent methodological advances for the analysis of change., These new analysis techniques have fundamentally altered how we conceptualize and study change. Researchers have begun to identify larger frameworks to integrate our knowledge regarding the analysis of change. One such framework is latent growth modeling, perhaps the most important and influential statistical revolution to have recently occurred in the social and behavioral sciences. This paper presents a basic introduction to a latent growth modeling approach for analyzing repeated measures data. Included is the specification and interpretation of the growth factors, primary extensions such as the analysis of growth in multiple populations, and structural models including both precursors of growth, and subsequent outcomes hypothesized to be influenced by the growth functions.},

Yet, there has been limited attention to how LGBT older adults maintain successful aging despite the adversity they face. Utilizing a Resilience Framework, this study investigates the relationship between physical and mental health-related quality of life (QOL) and covariates by age group.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of LGBT adults aged 50 and older (N = 2,560) was conducted by Caring and Aging with Pride: The National Health, Aging, and Sexuality Study via collaborations with 11 sites across the U.S. Linear regression analyses tested specified relationships and moderating effects of age groups (aged 50-64; 65-79; 80 and older).
RESULTS: Physical and mental health QOL were negatively associated with discrimination and chronic conditions and positively with social support, social network size, physical and leisure activities, substance nonuse, employment, income, and being male when controlling for age and other covariates. Mental health QOL was also positively associated with positive sense of sexual identity and negatively with sexual identity disclosure. Important differences by age group emerged and for the old-old age group the influence of discrimination was particularly salient.
IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to examine physical and mental health QOL, as an indicator of successful aging, among LGBT older adults. An understanding of the configuration of resources and risks by age group is important for the development of aging and health initiatives tailored for this growing population.},

In a single-paper meta-analysis across four studies, participants who read that LGBT groups were becoming more prevalent in the United States exhibited heightened perceptions of realistic threat and (especially) symbolic threat from these groups, which in turn predicted anti-LGBT prejudice. Two similar studies examining the growth of nonreligious groups demonstrated weaker effects.

	abstract = {The emergence of authoritarianism as a core political value has been emphasized by recent scholarship on the political behavior of the American electorate. This paper adds to this literature by examining the effect of authoritarianism in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Given the campaign style of Trump and the issues that he made salient in his campaign, it is hypothesized that authoritarianism should have a substantial effect on vote choice of whites. Using data from the American National Election Studies (ANES), logistic regression models of presidential vote choice of white respondents are estimated to ascertain the effect of authoritarianism in presidential elections from 1992 to 2016, controlling for party identification, ideology and several standard demographic control variables. Findings indicate that authoritarianism had the largest effect on white vote choice in 2016 than in any prior election that was analyzed. The candidacy of Trump appears to have been the triggering mechanism given that authoritarianism was a less salient predictor of U.S. House vote choice in 2016. Moreover, this relationship was true for both college and non-college educated whites. Authoritarianism also seems to have been primed by Trump appealing to racial animus, anti-immigration sentiment, nativism, and anti-Muslim prejudice. Authoritarianism is likely to remain a salient determinant of vote choice during the Trump era. Indeed, a widening and deepening of this cleavage means its effects are likely to be apparent in elections below the presidency.},

	abstract = {The 2016 presidential election was characterized by the remarkable expression of prejudice toward a range of groups. In two closely related studies (N = 388; 196 supporting Trump, 192 Clinton), we measured (1) perceptions of social norms toward prejudice or (2) people’s own levels of prejudice toward 19 social groups, shortly before and after the election. Some groups were targeted by the Trump campaign (e.g., Muslims, immigrants) and some were not (e.g., atheists, alcoholics). Participants saw an increase in the acceptability of prejudice toward groups Trump targeted but little shift in untargeted groups. By contrast, participants reported a personal drop in Trump-targeted prejudice, probably due changing comparison standards, with no change in prejudice toward untargeted groups. The 2016 election seems to have ushered in a normative climate that favored expression of several prejudices; this shift may have played a role in the substantial increase in bias-related incidents that follow closely upon the election.},

We measured the number of reported white-supremacist propaganda, anti-Semitic incidents, and extremist behaviors that occurred both leading up to and directly following these campaign events. We contend that Trump’s rhetoric and rallies increased the perceived threat facing white Americans, heightening their white identity, all while justifying violence and extralegal methods to address their grievances and thereby increasing reported bias incidents. We find that counties that hosted a Trump rally experienced an increase in hate-motivated events. We systematically show that Trump political rallies were associated with a limited size but significant rise in the likelihood of reported hate and bias incidents.},

	abstract = {Crimes motivated by hatred toward a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity typically cause greater physical and emotional harm than comparative crimes not motivated by hate. Compounding these impacts, hate crime victims receive less empathy, less support, and are blamed more for their victimization both by society in general and by criminal justice agencies. However, as hate crimes are the epitome of intergroup hostility, the crimes are also likely to engender an ingroup empathy bias in which fellow LGBT+ people provide greater empathy to hate crime victims, potentially motivating greater support and reducing victim blaming for these particularly marginalized victims. Across three studies, we examined LGBT+ participants’ empathic reactions to hate crime victims, along with their willingness to help victims and blame victims. In the Pilot Study (N = 131) and Study 1 (N = 600), we cross-sectionally showed that indirect experiences of hate crimes predicted a stronger LGBT+ identity which, in turn, was associated with greater empathy that predicted greater willingness to help victims and blame the victim less. In Study 2 (N = 657), we experimentally manipulated the motivation of a crime (hate vs. non-hate) and the group membership of the victim (ingroup-LGBT+ vs. outgroup-heterosexual) and found that crimes that had one or more group elements (i.e., involved an ingroup member and/or was motivated by hate) elicited greater empathy that, in turn, increased the willingness to help the victim and reduced victim blaming. Together, the findings provide cogent evidence that LGBT+ communities respond to anti-LGBT+ hate crimes with overwhelming empathy, and this ingroup empathy bias motivates helping behaviors and reduces victim blame, thereby buffering the marginalizing consequences of hate crimes. Policy implications include acknowledging and harnessing the importance of shared identities when practitioners and criminal justice agencies respond to anti-LGBT+ hate crimes.},

This study finds that victim characteristics may not impact victimization in the ways suggested by previous studies.

We examine research showing that many transgender people live on the margins of society, facing stigma, discrimination, exclusion, violence, and poor health. They often experience difficulties accessing appropriate health care, whether specific to their gender needs or more general in nature. Some governments are taking steps to address human rights issues and provide better legal protection for transgender people, but this action is by no means universal. The mental illness perspective that currently frames health-care provision for transgender people across much of the world is under scrutiny. The WHO diagnostic manual may soon abandon its current classification of transgender people as mentally disordered.

	abstract = {Introduction.
              Disparities in health and health care experienced by sexual and gender minorities in the United States (US) are well documented, and physical therapists (PTs) play a role in perpetuating them. This study aimed to determine to what degree lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) health education and training is integrated into physical therapy education curricula. Studies in medicine and nursing have led to increased curricular attention to LGBTQ health topics; yet, similar physical therapy education research has not been published.
            
            
              Methods.
              A link to an anonymous Google Forms survey was emailed to Program Directors (PDs) of US physical therapist education programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education for the academic years of 2015–2017. The survey gathered information on the current and optimal number of curricular hours spent on equitable care for LGBTQ patients and perceived barriers to inclusion of LGBTQ curriculum.
            
            
              Results.
              Seventy-two of 229 (31\%) programs responded to the survey. Half of the respondents reported inclusion of LGBTQ-related topics in the curriculum. The average number of current hours was 1.43 per year. The average number of optimal hours was 2.82 per year. Eighty-nine percent reported that one or more curricular hours per year should be included. Barriers to LGBTQ health education and training include perceived lack of time and adequate faculty training.
            
            
              Discussion.
              Most PDs believe that more hours should be dedicated to LGBTQ health topics. Open-ended question responses reflect various perspectives held by PDs regarding the importance of including LGBTQ health topics and barriers to inclusion. The development of core competencies may facilitate the inclusion of LGBTQ-specific health education in Doctor of Physical Therapy program curricula.
            
            
              Conclusion.
              Resources to educate faculty and students on LGBTQ health topics are readily available. These topics may be effectively woven into existing curricula, making it an attainable goal to increase the competency of entry-level PTs to assist in meeting the American Physical Therapy Association's mandate to provide nondiscriminatory care.},

Using seven samples from the United States and Israel, the authors confirm factor-analytic evidence and show predictive validity for both dimensions. In the United States, SDO-D was theorized and found to be more related to old-fashioned racism, zero-sum competition, and aggressive intergroup phenomena than SDO-E; SDO-E better predicted more subtle legitimizing ideologies, conservatism, and opposition to redistributive social policies. In a contentious hierarchical intergroup context (the Israeli-Palestinian context), SDO-D better predicted both conservatism and aggressive intergroup attitudes. Fundamentally, these analyses begin to establish the existence of complementary psychological orientations underlying the preference for group-based dominance and inequality.},

We outline a dual-process motivational (DPM) model of how these 2 dimensions originate from particular personality dispositions and socialized worldview beliefs and how and why their different underlying motivational goals or values generate their wide-ranging effects on social outcomes, such as prejudice and politics.
